# stock-analysis

# VBA

## Overview of Project 
In this project we refactored code we got from the module 2 pre-work sections to loop through all the data one time

### Purpose
Although the module 2 solution code works well, it might not have worked as well for aa larger number of stocks. So by refactoring the code we were able to analyse thousands of stocks and shorten execution time needed to do so. By refactoring the code, we did not add new functionality; we just made the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

## Results

### Analysis 
The refactored code ran significantly faster, with a run time of 0.26 seconds vs 53762.21 seconds

## Summary
Refactoring code helps in removing the complexions of the code and enhancing the reliability of the code. Code refactoring also helps in removing vulnerabilities of the system and also removes bugs. Basically it is a cycle of continues improvement of the code by different methods to make better. I would say the main disadvantage to refactoring is it being time consuming: you must reflect on whether the time you will save with your new code is worth the time spent on writing the new code! With our stocks analysis code, it did not take too much time, but it is worth weighing out the pros and cons. Additionally, Imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code.
